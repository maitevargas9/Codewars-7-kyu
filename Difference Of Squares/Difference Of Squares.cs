Description

Recreation of Project Euler problem #6

Find the difference between the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers (1 <= n <= 100) and the sum of their squares.

Example
For example, when n = 10:
The square of the sum of the numbers is:
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)² = 55² = 3025
The sum of the squares of the numbers is:
1² + 2² + 3² + 4² + 5² + 6² + 7² + 8² + 9² + 10² = 385
Hence the difference between square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of those numbers is: 
3025 - 385 = 2640
